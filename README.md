Git Workflow: Setting up the repository and managing Pull Requests to ensure code quality.

Code Review: Ensuring consistent coding standards across the entire codebase.

🚀 Key Features
Session Management: Real-time tracking of active user sessions and PC availability.

User Database: Secure storage and retrieval of club member information.

Tariff System: Automated calculation of costs based on session duration and hardware tier.

Reporting: Generation of daily reports for revenue and equipment usage.

CLI/GUI Interface: (Залежно від того, що ви реалізували — консольний інтерфейс або Swing/JavaFX).

🛠 Tech Stack
Java (JDK 17+): Core language using object-oriented programming.

Collections API: For efficient data management and storage.
